# ‚öõÔ∏è Quantum & Physics-Inspired Experiments Collection

This repository is a curated archive of personal quantum computing and physics-based exploratory projects. Each file represents an independent experiment or simulation that blends fundamental theory with creative implementation‚Äîspanning quantum algorithms, photonic simulations, cosmological quantization, and interactive learning models.

The goal of this repo is to explore emerging ideas at the intersection of **quantum computing**, **theoretical physics**, and **educational design**, with an emphasis on interpretability, originality, and conceptual depth.

## üìÅ Project Highlights

- `Beta Decay-Inspired Eigensolver.ipynb`  
  A novel approach to eigensolving inspired by the energetics of nuclear beta decay, applying a tunable decay operator to variational quantum circuits.

- `Floquet Time Crystal.ipynb`  
  Simulates discrete time translation symmetry breaking using a kicked Ising model, inspired by proposals for quantum time crystals.

- `Grovers_KNN.ipynb`  
  Hybrid quantum-classical algorithm that combines Grover‚Äôs search with k-nearest neighbors for optimized search within small datasets.

- `Quantum-Candyland.ipynb`  
  A playful, educational quantum board game simulation designed to introduce young students to quantum gates and probabilistic evolution.

- `Redshift Quantization.py`  
  A cosmology-inspired script that explores the possibility of quantized redshift behavior across astronomical distances.

- `Superfluid_Vortex.ipynb`  
  Models quantized vortex dynamics in a superfluid system using discretized circulation, inspired by vortex quantization in helium-4.
